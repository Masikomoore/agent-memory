# Changelog

All notable public Agent Memory changes will be recorded here.

## 0.1.0 - Initial public release

### Shared memory server

- Added a host-independent Memory Core for storage, retrieval, extraction, decay, tiering, and scopes.
- Added the standalone Agent Memory Server with REST and Streamable HTTP MCP endpoints.
- Added Bearer authentication plus Host/Origin validation for non-loopback deployment.
- Added shared global-memory defaults with explicit agent/project scope support.

### Agent integrations

- Added MCP client templates for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and VS Code.
- Added OpenClaw remote-memory mode so OpenClaw can use the central server instead of opening a separate local database.
- Verified a real cross-agent path: Claude Code capture → Codex CLI recall from the same server.

### Deployment

- Added a production Dockerfile.
- Added self-contained Docker Compose deployment with LanceDB persistence and local Ollama models.
- Added Coolify deployment guidance.

### Project launch

- Reorganized the project around a vendor-neutral shared-memory server rather than a single-agent plugin.
- Added independent project documentation, roadmap, contributing guide, security policy, and provenance notice.
